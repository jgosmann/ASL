{"name":"ASL","body":"Shader Based Image Manipulation with the Annotated Shading Language (ASL)\r\n=========================================================================\r\n\r\nThis project was done as part of the Computer Graphics module by Prof. Dr. Mario\r\nBotsch at the Bielefeld University in the summer term of 2011. It is an image\r\nmanipulation program which implements its algorithms in shader programs running\r\non the GPU.\r\n\r\nWe aimed to make this image manipulation program flexible and extensible.  \r\nTherefore, we decided to save the source code of the shaders in their own files \r\nwhich will be loaded and compiled at runtime. This makes it easy to add new \r\nalgorithms: just write a shader and you can load it from the program.\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be nice if one could control the various parameters of the \r\nalgorithms with GUI controls. But a normal shader program does not provide the \r\ninformation what the purpose and valid range of a parameter is. This is the \r\npoint were the Annotated Shading Language (ASL) comes into play.\r\n\r\nThe Annotated Shading Language allows to add information like description and\r\nparameter range of a parameter to the program. Because all ASL elements are\r\nwritten within comments, the shader program can still be compiled without using\r\nan ASL shader compiler.\r\n\r\nBecause ASL was developed only as part of a rather small project, there is still \r\nroom for many enhancements. For example, at the moment it is only possible to \r\nannotate uniforms and whole files, but not per vertex parameters. We had no need \r\nfor this function as we only used fragment shaders which do not have per vertex \r\nparameters.\r\n\r\nIf you want to try out ASL for yourself, take a look into the `doc` folder where\r\nyou will find a documentation of ASL.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com/) 4.6 (or newer)\r\n- [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/) 2.0 (or newer)\r\n- [flex](http://flex.sourceforge.net/)\r\n- [Bison](http://www.gnu.org/s/bison/)\r\n\r\nThe program should be platform independent. However, the final version was only\r\ntested with Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) at the time of writing this.\r\n\r\nKnown Problems\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n- Not all shaders will work with Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion). It seems that Qt messes\r\n  up the initialization of the OpenGL context on that platform. Presumably\r\n  because Lion introduced OpenGL 3. The problem may be fixed with Qt versions\r\n  > 4.7. However, it still persisted in the beta version of Qt 4.8.\r\n\r\nAuthors\r\n-------\r\n\r\n- [Jan Gosmann](http://www.hyper-world.de)\r\n- Denis John\r\n- Markus Kastrop\r\n\r\nThe project has been supervised by Matthias Heinrich and Prof. Dr. Mario Botsch.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Annotated Shading Language","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
